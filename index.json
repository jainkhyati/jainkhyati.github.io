This would help build more reliable and interpretable systems, critical in real-world settings. Recently, I was a summer intern at Google where I worked on multi-modal information extraction. I have also been interested in quantum computing and am looking forward to explore it further.\nI am actively looking for full time opportunities in software development starting from Aug \u0026lsquo;21.
